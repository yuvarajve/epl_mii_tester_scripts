Powerlink Demo
--------------

Setup
-----

In order to run the demo you will need::
   - Slicekit L16 (the powerlink node, or Controlled Node (CN) )
   - Two ethernet slices XA-SK-E100
   - One GPIO slice - XA-SK-GPIO
   - One ethernet cable
   - Windows laptop for running the Powerlink master (Managing Node = "MN")
   - Slicekit Power plug 
   
First install the open source powerlink demo for windows on your laptop(Laptop 1). It can be found here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpowerlink/

Laptop Setup Notes
------------------

   * The Windows Laptop must have ethernet services turned off(DHCP etc). If they are not then the Master will probably come out of operational.
   * Apply to XMOS IT services for assistance in doing this

SliceKIT setup notes
--------------------

Ensure you have a sliceKIT labelled "Powerlink Demo 0v1".

   1. Plug ethernet slices into Circle and Square
   2. Plug GPIO Slice in Star
   3. Connect ethernet cable from Circle ethernet slice into Laptop 
   4. Connect power to slicekit
   
Run the demo:

This demo is running a  CANopen-over-Powerlink 401 profle. Our GPIO slice is acting as the IO Module. The sliceKIT is CN1 ("Controlled Node 1").

What you should See
-------------------

   #. On the laptop you ee the words 'CN1' with a green light next to it which means that the XMOS powerlink node has reached "powerlink operational state".
   #. At the bottom of the screen there should be a green light which says "Operational" next to it.
   #. Digital Input and Digital Output lights should be shown, the digital outputs should be slowly changing, these are under control of the master node running on the laptop.
   
What you should do
------------------

   #. Digital inputs are controlled by the XMOS CN, one should be lit. 
   #. You can demonstrate that this is a bona fide demo by using a button on the GPIO slice to move the inut light which is lit to the left or right. The other GPIO button will cause a move in the alternative direction.
