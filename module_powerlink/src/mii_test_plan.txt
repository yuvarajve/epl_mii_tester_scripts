MII testing
RX
 * verify correct CRC is calculated - error reported in case of fail, frame discarded
 * link down during rx doesn't form a valid frame
 * if all channels send commands at the same time as an rx then the rx is not dropped
 * if a frame is received on port 0 during the reception of a frame on port 1 then port 0 is ignored
 * if a long frame is received on port 0 during the reception of a short frame on port 1 then the interframe gap only begins after port 0 has finished receveing
 * preamble regeneration works
 * check that frames of 1522 bytes fit
 * test the double frame buffer, i.e. finish with the first frame during the reception of the second.
 * over clock the rx, under clock the rx, within spec limits
 * rx frames with word amount of bytes, up to a word plus three amount of bytes.
 * test the ack interface to the mii
 * verify that the clients can take the data from the channel to never cause a block
 * Check both ports indepentantly, i.e. all tests for port 0 and port 1

Extension work
 - limit frame to 1522 bytes
 - catch over acked clients

TX

 * frames from 48-80 bytes long - tests the padding to 64 byte frame length when the tx data is less than 64 bytes (-CRC)
 * verify correct CRC is calculated + appended to frame
 * tx frames with word amount of bytes, up to a word plus three amount of bytes.
 * test the ack interface to the clients
 * over clock the tx, under clock the tx, within spec limits
 * tune the IFG to minimise the latency
 	- rx -> tx
 	- rx(collision) -> tx
 	- tx -> tx 
 	- each has to be tested with word to word plus three byte lengths
 * Check both ports indepentantly, i.e. all tests for port 0 and port 1
 * one tx per tx_req, i.e. no double sending
 
Extension work
 - limit frame to 1522 bytes
 - catch over tx requested clients

Hub
 * Check the hub spec for a half duplex 100MB hub. Make sure this is it.
 
 
General
 * check that a packet can be recieved and immediatly after a packet can be sent. In this case check two conditions:
   1. tx packet sent to the mii during the rx
   2. tx packet sent to the mii in the ifg
