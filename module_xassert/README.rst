:description: Lightweight and flexible assertion module
:keywords: debug, assertion, assert

This module provides a lightweight and flexible replacement for the
standard C header ``assert.h``.

The assertions in this module can be be enabled/disabled
and configured as to how much debug information they show. This
configuration can be per "debug unit" (i.e. for sets of files).
